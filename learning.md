# My Learning again

I created a folder called Redux to host all the context code

Then, I created the action.ts folder
> The action folder calls the the api

Then, I proceeded to create reducer.ts, this makes uses of the action, each actions can have its own reducers,

Then I create store using the reducers

I then create a file called provider.tsx at the root of the application

Then check the code in the provider.tsx
